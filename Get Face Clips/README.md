# Get Face ClipsThis python notebook is able to get the face clips from single-face images in batches, so that it can help you build some training data sets easily.Put all the single-face images in the input folder, run the program, and get the face clips in the out put folder. Examples can be found in my input/output folders.You can set the input/output folder (according to the relative path) in the notebook.
